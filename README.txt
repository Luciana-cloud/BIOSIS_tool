Description:
These datasets represent the input of a user-flexible tool to support decision-making during the selection process of soil biological methods for monitoring soil functions. 
The decision support tool is based on a structured and conceptual framework that connects soil biota to soil functions through their contribution to different soil processes.

Keywords:
method selection, logical sieve, monitoring, soil biota, soil functions

Temporal coverage:
The datasets and related R script were created between 2020-2021, and they contain information from papers published between 1960 and 2020.

This dataset contains the following files:
-R script connected to the logical sieve decision making tool: 'BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021'.
-csv file with scoring of the soil biological methods that is used with the R script: 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores'.
-csv file with weighting factors: 'Weighting_factors'. In this document the weighting factors are all set to 1. In the R script 'BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021'
is explained that users can adjust these weighting factors manually to indicate the importance of different technical criteria to their assessment program. 
-excel file with methods references: 'Supplementary information Methods references'. These references were used to give the scores present in the file 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores'
-csv file with explanation of the variables contained in the files: 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores' and 'Weighting_factors'.

Explanation of variables:
The variables used in the files 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores' and 'Weighting_factors' are explained in the csv file 'Explanation_variables'.

Methods, materials and software:
For a complete description of the methods used to collect and generate the data and the R script we refer to the publication 
Zwetsloot et al., 2021. 'Designing a flexible method selection tool for the inclusion of soil biology measurements in the assessment of soil multi-functionality'.

Access:
An embargo on this data and R script is required until the paper 
Zwetsloot et al., 2021. 'Designing a flexible method selection tool for the inclusion of soil biology measurements in the assessment of soil multi-functionality' is published.
