## Biosis 2.0

This tool expands on the work of Zwetsloot et al., 2021 to incorporate the following changes:

1. Ranking of physicochemical and environmental parameters.
2. Effects of scale on the ranking of the parameters.
3. Effects of the stakeholder's perspective on the importance of soil functions. 
4. Different land uses (forest and urban).

This dataset contains the following files:
- Original code: BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021.R
- Modified code: test_file.R
- File to translate the data from the cognitive models to the desired format: data_preparation.R
-csv file with scoring of the soil biological methods that is used with the R script: 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores'.
-csv file with weighting factors: 'Weighting_factors'. In this document the weighting factors are all set to 1. In the R script 'BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021'
is explained that users can adjust these weighting factors manually to indicate the importance of different technical criteria to their assessment program. 
-excel file with methods references: 'Supplementary information Methods references'. These references were used to give the scores present in the file 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores'
-csv file with explanation of the variables contained in the files: 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores' and 'Weighting_factors'.

Explanation of variables:
The variables used in the files 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores' and 'Weighting_factors' are explained in the csv file 'Explanation_variables'.
