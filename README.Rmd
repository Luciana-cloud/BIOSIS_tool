## Biosis 2.0

This tool expands on the work of Zwetsloot et al., 2021 to incorporate
the following changes:

1.  Ranking of physicochemical and environmental parameters (in
    progress).
2.  Effects of scale on the ranking of the parameters (example is
    implemented).
3.  Effects of the stakeholder's perspective on the importance of soil
    functions (example is implemented).
4.  Different land uses (forest and urban) (in progress).

This dataset contains the following files:

-   Original code: BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021.R

-   Modified code: test_file.R

-   File to translate the data from the cognitive models to the desired
    format: data_preparation.R

-   Data to run the original tool: data folder

    -   csv file with scoring of the soil biological methods that is
        used with the R script: 'Supplementary
        information_Methods_scores'.

    -   csv file with weighting factors: 'Weighting_factors'. In this
        document the weighting factors are all set to 1. In the R script
        'BIOSIS_method_selection_tool_March2021' is explained that users
        can adjust these weighting factors manually to indicate the
        importance of different technical criteria to their assessment
        program.

    -   excel file with methods references: 'Supplementary information
        Methods references'. These references were used to give the
        scores present in the file 'Supplementary
        information_Methods_scores'

    -   csv file with explanation of the variables contained in the
        files: 'Supplementary information_Methods_scores' and
        'Weighting_factors'.

-   Data for the current version of the Biosis tool is temporarily
    stored in Google Drive.

### Explanation of variables:

The variables used in the files 'Supplementary
information_Methods_scores' and 'Weighting_factors' are explained in the
csv file 'Explanation_variables'.

### Methods, materials, and software:

For a complete description of the methods used to collect and generate
the data and the R script we refer to the publication:
