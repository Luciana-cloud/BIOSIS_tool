Tier,Criterium,Explanation
Pertinence,,
,CR_functional,The degree by which an actor or process method provides information about the functional capacity of a soil to deliver the Carbon management and climate regulation soil function.
,DS_functional,The degree by which an actor or process method provides information about the functional capacity of a soil to deliver Disease and Pest management soil function.
,NC_functional,The degree by which an actor or process method provides information about the functional capacity of a soil to deliver the Nutrient Cycling soil function.
,WR_functional,The degree by which an actor or process method provides information about the functional capacity of a soil to deliver Water Regulation and Purification soil function.
,MF_functional,The degree by which an actor or process method provides information about the functional capacity of a soil to deliver all the four soil functions.
,CR_freq,Number of occurrences of an actor or a process within the Carbon management and climate regulation soil  function model. 
,NC_freq,Number of occurrences of an actor or a process within the Disease and Pest management soil function model. 
,WR_freq,Number of occurrences of an actor or a process within the Water regulation and purification soil function model. 
,DS_freq,Number of occurrences of an actor or a process within the Disease and Pest management soil function model. 
,MF_freq,Number of occurrences of an actor or a process within all the four soil function models. 
,CR_rel,"Expert-opinion score on the relevance of the actor to the delivery of a process. If actors contributed to multiple processes, scores were averaged to obtain a relevance score at the  Carbon management and climate regulation  function level. "
,NC_rel,"Expert-opinion score on the relevance of the actor to the delivery of a process. If actors contributed to multiple processes, scores were averaged to obtain a relevance score at the Nutrient Cycling function level. "
,WR_rel,"Expert-opinion score on the relevance of the actor to the delivery of a process. If actors contributed to multiple processes, scores were averaged to obtain a relevance score at the Water regulation and purification function level. "
,DS_rel,"Expert-opinion score on the relevance of the actor to the delivery of a process. If actors contributed to multiple processes, scores were averaged to obtain a relevance score at the Disease and Pest management function level. "
,MF_rel,"Expert-opinion score on the relevance of the actor to the delivery of a process. If actors contributed to multiple processes, scores were averaged to obtain a relevance score at the four soil function level. "
